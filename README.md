Toolbox for NWO Optical Superhighways WP1.

Andrew's book refers to "Laser Beam Propagation through Random Media"
2nd edition by Larry C. Andrews and Ronald L. Phillips.

The purpose of this toolbox is to be able to compare simulation results
to theoretical results, without having to re-program the equations.

Additionally, to create plots based on theory.

I have also added some plotters to this toolbox to help visualize data.

Any questions about the toolbox can be sent to seppala(at)strw.leidenuniv.nl.
